If you're happy to sacrifice a little time for a less compressed image, that's fine too: you can toggle this setting in Settings > Advanced. \n\nBug Fixes \n• Fixed: When using an external keyboard with an iPad, some keyboard shortcuts were not behaving as they should — or, in fact, at all. They have been brought back in line, and should now function just as you'd expect. \n• Fixed: You can now use the quick switcher to switch to a DM session with someone no longer on your team. Because people may leave, but knowledge remains. It's a very useful thing that way.",

      "description": "\"Best of 2015\" by Apple\nMailTime is an open mobile messenger built with email technology. It’s email as quick and easy as texting, and messaging without forcing all your contacts to download the same app. \n\nWe reformat your cluttered email threads into clean bubble conversations and separate the important human messages in your inbox from the discounts and newsletters.\n\nMailTime supports multiple email accounts, as well as Gmail, iCloud, Yahoo, Outlook, AOL, Office 365, Mail.ru, Hotmail, QQ,163, 126, Tencent Enterprise, Google Apps Mail services. You can also attach files from Dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive, Box, and One Drive with MailTime. \n\nUPDATE: Now users can search within MailTime from any screen using the Spotlight Search. Jump into a new email with 3D Touch, Peek into emails before opening, Swipe a quick reply, or Long Press to expand email bubbles, addresses, contacts and web links with ease.  \n\n------------\nFeatures\n\nEmail Messaging:\nOur content parsing engine cuts out annoying metadata to display emails in clean bubbles. View your emails as conversations, not threads!\n\nCommunicate, Don't Organize:\nOur intelligent inbox sorts out the Important humans from the newsletters, discounts, and other machine-generated mail in All Mail. Talk to people you care about, not machines!\n\nGroup Chats:\nManaging your conversations in MailTime is just like a group chat. To add, remove, or switch participants to 'cc' or 'bcc', just swipe left and change your participants' status. \n\nOne Click To-dos:\nUse the @ symbol to quickly assign tasks without leaving the inbox.  For example, \"@Charlie, Please download MailTime\", will put the rest of that sentence into Charlie's Mentions list, next to the group status list.\n\nToo Long; Didn't Read:\nJust like Twitter prevents you from writing more than 140 characters, MailTime alerts you if your message is too long. You can still send them, but no guarantees that they'll be read!\n\n------------\nFAQ\n\n“What does it look like to someone who doesn't have the app?”\nTo non-MailTime users, messages appear as normal emails. If you'd like to view the original email within MailTime, you can tap on the corresponding bubble.\n\n“What about long emails and attachments?”\nWe've noticed that most people save their essays for desktop and leave quick responses for mobile, but we've got you covered. MailTime shortens all messages to fit the screen, and to see the rest, simply tap that bubble. Attachments are visible on the bottom of the bubble and similarly accessible.\n\n“Can I swipe away all my emails in MailTime?”\nWe don’t treat your inbox as a task list. That’s what Mentions are for - tag a recipient with the @ symbol to assign the rest of the sentence to that person’s task list. However, you can Mark as Read, Archive, and Delete all with easy swipes!\n------------\nAs featured in Forbes, Business Insider, CNBC, LifeHacker, Fox, and TC Disrupt Startup Battlefield 2014.\n\nWe love emails! Talk to us anytime by clicking the “Write to MailTime Team” button or send an email to support@mailtime.com\n\nFollow us on Twitter at @mailtimeapp, \nlike us on Facebook at /mailtimeapp or \nvisit our website mailtime.com\n\nHave A Good MailTime!",
